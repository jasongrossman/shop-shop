# shop-shop

## Description
Shop shop is an e-commerce website that allows users to purchase various items from the online catalogue.

This app permits users to browse by categories, drill into individual products for more details, and purchase multiple units of these products.

Shop shop contains a shopping cart feature, allowing users to build baskets before checking out. This feature requires users to be logged in members.

Payment rails are handled by Stripe, but is currently configured for development use only. Upon successful checkout, users are redirected to a success page, followed by the home landing page. All previous transactions are logged in the Order history page.

This application is powered by React, using Redux for Global State management
